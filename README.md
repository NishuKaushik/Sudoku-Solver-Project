Sudoku Solver Project

The Sudoku Solver project is a Java-based application designed to solve any given Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a popular number puzzle game that consists of a 9x9 grid divided into 3x3 sub-grids. The objective is to fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 9 such that each row, each column, and each 3x3 sub-grid contains all the numbers from 1 to 9 without repeating.

Key Features:

1.Input and Output:


The application accepts a 9x9 Sudoku board as input, where empty cells are represented by zeros.
It prints the initial Sudoku board, attempts to solve it, and then prints the solved board if a solution is found.

2.Backtracking Algorithm:


The solver uses the backtracking technique to fill the empty cells. This involves trying out each number from 1 to 9 in an empty cell and recursively checking if it leads to a valid solution.
If placing a number leads to a conflict, the algorithm backtracks by resetting the cell to empty (0) and trying the next number.

3.Validation Methods:


The solver includes methods to check if placing a number in a specific cell is valid. These methods ensure that the number does not already exist in the same row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid.

Code Breakdown:

1.Main Method:


Initializes a sample Sudoku board.
Prints the initial board.
Calls the solveBoard method to solve the puzzle.
Prints the solved board if a solution is found, or indicates that the board is unsolvable.

2.Printing the Board:


The printBoard method prints the Sudoku board in a readable format, separating the 3x3 sub-grids for better visualization.

3.Validation Methods:


isNumberInRow: Checks if a number is present in a given row.
isNumberInColumn: Checks if a number is present in a given column.
isNumberInBox: Checks if a number is present in a specific 3x3 sub-grid.
isValidPlacement: Uses the above methods to verify if placing a number in a specific cell is valid.

4.Backtracking Solver:


solveBoard: Iterates through each cell in the board. For each empty cell, it tries placing numbers from 1 to 9, validates the placement, and recursively attempts to solve the board.
If a placement leads to a solution, it returns true. If no number leads to a solution, it backtracks by resetting the cell and returns false.
